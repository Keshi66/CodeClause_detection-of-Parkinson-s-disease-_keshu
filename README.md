# CodeClause_detection-of-Parkinson-s-disease-_keshu
In this Python machine learning project, I  built a model to detect Parkinson’s disease using one of the Classifier techniques known as RandomForestClassifier . I load  the dataset, get the features and targets, split them into training and testing sets, and finally pass them to RandomForestClassifier for prediction.

Parkinson’s disease is a central nervous system disorder. Its symptoms occur because of low dopamine levels in the brain. Four Primary symptoms are tremor, rigidity, slow movement and 
balance problems. Till now no cure for Parkinson’s Disease is known, treatment aims to reduce the effects of the symptoms.

Steps for detecting Parkinson’s disease:

1. Import Libraries

2. Preprocessing

3.  Normalization

4.  Training and Testing

5.  Building the classifier model

6.  Prediction and Accuracy

7.   Building the Prediction System.

8.   Detect Parkinson’s Disease Output.

In this Machine learning project, I developed a model using the RandomForestClassifier of the sklearn module of python to detect if an individual has Parkinson’s Disease or not. I got the machine learning model with 97.43% accuracy and that's awsome!
